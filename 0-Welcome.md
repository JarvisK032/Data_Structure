# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial.  Every beginning data scientist should understand these basic topics:

- [Queue](1-Queue.md)
- [Set](2-Set.md)
- [Tree](3-Tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
